glewinit() error:
1. can not find glewInit glewExperimental and so on 
solve: use the glew32s.lib 32bit version! (this is the vs linker version compatible issu)
2 can not find gl version
solve: I know this answer comes a bit late, but I don't see you making the OpenGL context current by calling glfwMakeContextCurrent(window). You have to do that before calling glewInit()
